# Azure-104 - Learning Path
> Quick Note: While the official learning path of microsoft is structured soundly, it isn't a one-to-one execute and pass solution, but rather a guide, you still have to learn and develop a strategy on your own which to some can be cumbersome, this is why I reworked the modules and learning path, using the offical Microsoft Learning Path as a source [Microsoft Official Learning Path for Azure 104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/).

## Introduction
Now you may ask, what is different about this Learning Path, it is quite simple; Microsofts official learning path is too linear and theoretical in approach, and to top it off it doesn't force to troubleshoot. My learning path, while drawing from the resources of [Microsoft Official Learning Path for Azure 104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/), incorporates one crucial aspect the official learning path doesn't:

```
Build → Break → Fix
```

This forces you to actually deploy, break, and troubleshoot; which in turn builds alot of practical experience and theoretical knowledge.
You'll learn these things over 7 phases. These 7 Phases will consist of the following:
* Phase 1: Prerequisites for Azure administrators
* Phase 2: Manage identities and governance in Azure
* Phase 3: Implement and manage storage in Azure
* Phase 4: Deploy and manage Azure compute resources
* Phase 5: Configure and manage virtual networks for Azure administrators
* Phase 6: Monitor and Backup Azure resources
* Phase 7: Exam prep

> very important note: each phase will incorporate material and resources from [Microsoft Official Learning Path for Azure 104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/), meaning you will still have to visit Microsofts leaning path site to get the full benefit of this learning path.
