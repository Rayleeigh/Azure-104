# Azure-104 - Learning Path
> Quick Note: While the official learning path of microsoft is structured soundly, it isn't a one-to-one execute and pass solution, but rather a guide, you still have to learn and develop a strategy on your own which to some can be cumbersome, this is why I reworked the modules and learning path, using the offical Microsoft Learning Path as a source [Microsoft Official Learning Path for Azure 104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/)

## Introduction
Now you may ask, what is different about this Learning Path, it is quite simple; Microsofts official learning path is too linear and theoretical in approach, and to top it off it doesn't force to troubleshoot. My learning path, while drawing from the resources of [Microsoft Official Learning Path for Azure 104](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/), incorporates one crucial aspect the official learning path doesn't:

```
Build → Break → Fix
```

This forces you to actually deploy, break, and troubleshoot; which in turn builds alot of practical experience and theoretical knowledge.
You'll learn these things over 7 phases.
