# **PHASE MODULE NAME**
> This module focuses on building **deep, exam-relevant understanding** of a specific Azure concept.
> It is based on the official Microsoft Learn material, extended with **failure scenarios, troubleshooting exercises, and reasoning-driven solutions**.
>  
> Official reference: [Microsoft Learn – Module](LinkToMicrosoftModule)

---

## **Purpose**
> One or two sentences explaining **what this module trains you to think about**, not just what it covers.

---

## **Pre-requisites**
You should already be comfortable with:

- Required concept / previous phase module
- Required Azure service or tool
- Any assumptions the exam makes at this point

---

## **Microsoft Learn Modules**
> These modules provide the **theoretical foundation** for this Phase Module.

- [Microsoft Learn Module](LinkToMsLearnModules)

---

## **Exam Focus**
> This section exists to align learning with **how AZ-104 questions are framed**.

**Keywords & Signals**
- Common wording used in exam scenarios
- Subtle signals that indicate what the exam is really testing

**What the Exam Wants You to Choose**
- The *minimum* correct solution
- The *correct scope*
- The *correct service or tool*

---

## **Real-World Note**
> How this would typically be handled in a production environment.

- What you would automate instead
- What you would design differently at scale
- Why the exam expects a simpler answer

> _“In reality you’d do X, but the exam wants Y.”_

---

## **Theory**
> Conceptual explanations and mental models for this module.

- Link to theory documents
- Diagrams or decision matrices
- Definitions the exam assumes you already know

---

## **Exercises**
> Hands-on scenarios following the **Build → Break → Fix** methodology.

- Build: What to deploy or configure
- Break: What to misconfigure intentionally
- Fix: What must be diagnosed and corrected

> **Important:** Do not proceed to the solutions until you have attempted a fix.

---

## **Exercise Solutions**
> Reasoned solutions, not just answers.

Each solution should explain:
- Why this fix works
- Why alternative fixes are incorrect
- Why this is the **exam-expected** choice
