# **PHASE NAME**
> This phase is designed to build an **elite-level understanding** of Azure concepts relevant to the AZ-104 exam.
> It is based on the official Microsoft Learn learning path, with deliberate modifications to enforce **hands-on practice, failure analysis, and troubleshooting discipline**.
>  
> Official reference: [Microsoft Learn – Phase Module Overview](LinkToMicrosoftModule)

---

## **Purpose**
> A short, sharp explanation of *why this phase exists* and *what problems it eliminates*.
> Focus on **capability**, not content coverage.

---

## **Phase Modules**
> Below is an overview of the modules included in this phase and the specific capability each one develops.

| Phase Module | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Module 1 | What this module trains you to understand or diagnose |
| Module 2 | What failure mode or concept this module isolates |
| Module 3 | What exam-relevant judgment this module builds |
---

## **Microsoft Learn Modules**
> The following Microsoft Learn modules provide the **theoretical baseline** for this phase.
> They are required, but **not sufficient on their own**.

- [Microsoft Learn Module 1](LinkToMsLearnModules)
- [Microsoft Learn Module 2](LinkToMsLearnModules)

## **Build → Break → Fix Emphasis**
This phase is intentionally structured to enforce:

- **Build**: Deploy and configure Azure resources correctly
- **Break**: Introduce controlled misconfigurations and failures
- **Fix**: Diagnose root cause and apply the **minimum effective correction**

> The goal is not speed, but **precision and understanding**.

---

## **Exit Criteria**
You should **not proceed to the next phase** unless you can:

- Demonstrate understanding without relying on step-by-step guides
- Explain *why* a solution works and *why alternatives are incorrect*
- Apply fixes at the **lowest effective scope**
- Recognize common AZ-104 traps related to this phase
